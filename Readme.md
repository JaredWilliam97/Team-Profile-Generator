I created Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so youâ€™ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

I provided a link to a walk through video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing.

This homework will combine many of the skills we've covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

My application used Jest for running the unit tests and used Inquirer as well.

This project was very challenging which took me a long time to figure out.

I created a walk through video so you can see the functionality.
